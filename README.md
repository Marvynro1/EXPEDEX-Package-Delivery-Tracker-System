# EXPEDEX Package Delivery System

## Background

This project is something I built to simulate a **real-world package delivery system** for a logistics operation, specifically designed for supervisors to keep track of overall logistics operations. The idea was to provide an easy way to **monitor trucks, drivers, and package details**—everything from **total mileage** to **delivery times** and **deadlines**.

The system is built to help supervisors track three trucks and two drivers, ensuring that packages are delivered on time and as efficiently as possible. While I used the **nearest neighbor algorithm** to optimize the routes, the system itself didn’t automatically achieve the reduced mileage. Through manual testing and improvements to the algorithm, I managed to bring down the mileage over time.

## Data Structure Overview

Here’s a quick breakdown of how the data is structured and what you can expect:

- **Distance Matrix**: A 2D matrix representing the distances between delivery addresses. The nearest neighbor algorithm uses this matrix to calculate the **shortest possible route** for each truck.
- **Dynamic Hash Table**: This stores all the package data, allowing for **fast lookups** when the supervisor (or anyone really) needs to check specific details about a package.
- **CSV Files**:
    - `Package.csv`: This file contains all the relevant package details like ID, address, city, state, ZIP code, deadline, weight, and any special notes (like delayed deliveries or wrong addresses).
    - `Distance_Matrix.csv`: Contains precomputed distances between every address.
    - `Address.csv`: Maps each address to an index in the distance matrix so we know which addresses are closest to each other.

## Executive Summary

The program is designed to help a **supervisor** track package delivery operations in a logistics setup with **three trucks** and **two drivers**. It uses a **command-line interface (CLI)** where the user can monitor key details, like:

- **Total mileage** for all trucks
- **Delivery times** for each package
- **Deadlines** and **dispatch times**
- **Special notes** like package delays or wrong addresses
- **Addresses and package weight**

The nearest neighbor algorithm I implemented helps optimize the routes. However, the system didn't automatically reduce the total mileage; it required **manual testing** and adjustments on my part to get the routes more efficient.

### What this Program Does:

- Assigns packages to three trucks and two drivers.
- Uses the **nearest neighbor algorithm** to optimize routes.
- Provides real-time **status updates** on packages through the CLI.
- Tracks important information like delivery times, total mileage, and package deadlines.

Through manual testing and improving the nearest neighbor algorithm, I was able to reduce the total mileage from 247 miles to **121 miles**, which represents a **51% reduction**. This process involved several iterations and manual adjustments to improve the efficiency of the routes.

## Algorithm Choices

### **Strengths of the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**

I chose the **nearest neighbor algorithm** for its **ease of implementation** and simplicity. It works by selecting the nearest unvisited location from the current point and continues this process for the remaining destinations. Since the dataset is relatively small, this approach can quickly create an efficient route (within the **140-mile threshold**), although it may not always be the most optimal route. Still, it produces near-optimal results quickly.

### **Verification of the Algorithm**

The nearest neighbor algorithm successfully met all package constraints and special notes. It optimized the delivery within the **140-mile limit**, using just **two drivers** and **three trucks** to deliver all **40 packages** by their respective deadlines. This verification shows that the algorithm meets the project's key requirements.

### **Other Possible Algorithms**

While the nearest neighbor algorithm worked well for this scenario, I also considered two other algorithms—**2-opt** and **cheapest insertion**—that could potentially provide more optimal solutions. These algorithms may be more effective for larger datasets or when minimizing total distance is critical.

- **2-opt Algorithm**: This algorithm is a **route improvement heuristic**, meaning it takes an existing route (like one generated by the nearest neighbor algorithm) and improves it by swapping two non-adjacent edges to shorten the total distance. The process continues until no further improvements can be made.
  
- **Cheapest Insertion Algorithm**: Another **greedy algorithm**, this approach inserts a new location between two existing points on the route in a way that minimizes the increase in total mileage. This process repeats until all locations have been added.

Both of these algorithms could lead to lower total mileage and may be worth exploring if further optimization is needed.

## Data Structures

### **Verification of the Hash Table**

The **hash table** used in the solution meets the project requirements. It provides **O(1) time complexity** for package insertion and lookup, ensuring **fast access** and updates for delivery confirmations. It also allows the supervisor to track the progress of each truck and the status of all packages efficiently.

### **Other Data Structures**

Two other data structures that could meet the same requirements are the **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and the **AVL Tree**.

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A hierarchical structure with average **O(log n)** time complexity. However, if the tree becomes unbalanced, performance can degrade to **O(n)**.

- **AVL Tree**: A **self-balancing** version of the BST that maintains **O(log n)** time complexity even in the worst case by performing rotations to keep the tree balanced.

While both of these structures are useful, the **hash table** offers **faster lookups and updates** (O(1)) and doesn’t need to maintain any particular order of elements, making it a better choice for this application.

## Scalability Considerations

As the project currently deals with a small dataset, the hash table and nearest neighbor algorithm perform well. However, if the system were scaled up to handle **thousands of packages** and **more trucks**, the performance of the nearest neighbor algorithm could degrade. In such cases, more advanced algorithms like **2-opt** or even **metaheuristic approaches** (e.g., genetic algorithms) might be needed to maintain **route efficiency** as the dataset grows.

For the data structure side, while the **hash table** performs well in this case, if the system needed to handle **larger datasets** with more frequent lookups, an **AVL tree** might provide more consistent performance due to its balancing properties, ensuring that **insertion and lookup times remain predictable**.

## Recommendations

1. **Expand to Handle Dynamic Inputs**:
   - Currently, the system is static, but allowing the **dynamic addition of packages** during the delivery process would reflect real-world situations more accurately. Trucks often receive new packages mid-route, and being able to update the delivery schedule accordingly would increase **operational flexibility**. This would reduce **last-minute delivery failures** and **increase customer satisfaction** by ensuring more packages get delivered efficiently.

   - **Business Value**: This feature would improve the **agility** of the delivery process, helping logistics companies handle unexpected deliveries or customer requests in real-time. **Flexibility leads to fewer missed deadlines**, reducing costs related to re-deliveries and improving customer satisfaction.

2. **Integration with Real-Time Traffic Data**:
   - Adding **real-time traffic or road closure data** would further optimize routes by accounting for real-world driving conditions. Trucks could avoid traffic jams or delays, which would make deliveries faster and more reliable.

   - **Business Value**: This would result in faster delivery times, reducing fuel costs and **improving the reliability of ETAs** (estimated times of arrival). Reliable ETAs lead to **better customer experiences** and **increased trust in the company’s service**, which can be a differentiating factor in a competitive industry.

3. **Real-World Application with GPS Integration**:
   - Extending the system with **GPS integration** would allow supervisors to track trucks in real-time, giving them a full view of the fleet’s location and progress. This would enable better oversight, especially for time-sensitive or high-priority deliveries.

   - **Business Value**: Having real-time GPS tracking would enhance **transparency** and **accountability** in the logistics process. Supervisors could make more informed decisions, like re-routing trucks in real-time or reallocating resources to handle delays. This leads to **reduced delivery times**, **lower operational costs**, and an **improved overall delivery network**.

## Business Value

By leveraging **efficient data structures and algorithms**, this project addresses key logistical challenges faced by delivery services:
- **Cost Reduction**: Significant reduction in mileage driven leads to lower fuel costs and less wear-and-tear on vehicles.
- **Improved Delivery Accuracy**: The system ensures packages are delivered within their deadlines, **increasing customer satisfaction**.
- **Scalability**: The dynamic hash table makes it easy to **scale up** the system as the number of packages grows without performance issues.
